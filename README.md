# VS Code legacy csproj 
Are you working on a very old codebase where upgrading to a sdk style project is not possible in a timely manner?
Do you work with other developers who use Visual Studio? Well then this extension is for you.

This vscode extension automatically keeps your legacy csproj (non sdk project) up to date as you add and remove files.
